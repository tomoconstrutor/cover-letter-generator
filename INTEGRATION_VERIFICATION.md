   - Changes are reflected in real-time
   - Content state is maintained

6. **Regeneration Workflow**: ✅
   - Regenerate modal opens correctly
   - Additional context can be provided
   - New version is generated and displayed

7. **PDF Download**: ✅
   - Download button triggers PDF generation
   - PDF service creates properly formatted document
   - File is downloaded with correct filename

8. **Error Handling**: ✅
   - API errors are caught and displayed
   - Retry functionality works correctly
   - User can recover from error states

## 🔧 Technical Integration Points

### Service Layer
```typescript
// All services properly exported and integrated
import { openaiService } from './services/openaiService';
import { pdfService } from './services/pdfService';
import { retryService } from './services/retryService';
```

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Proper component hierarchy and data flow
App
├── ErrorBoundary
├── InputForm
├── CoverLetterDisplay
├── ApiKeyModal
├── RegenerateModal
└── ErrorDisplay
```

### State Flow
```typescript
// Centralized state management in App component
const [appState, setAppState] = useState<AppState>(DEFAULT_APP_STATE);
const [errorState, errorActions] = useErrorHandler();
const { apiKey, isConfigured, updateApiKey } = useApiKey();
```

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Optimization
- Production build: ~714KB (gzipped: ~222KB)
- Code splitting implemented for large dependencies
- Tree shaking removes unused code

### Runtime Performance
- React components optimized with useCallback and useMemo
- Error boundaries prevent cascading failures
- Efficient state updates minimize re-renders

## 🛡️ Error Recovery Mechanisms

### API Failures
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Network Issues
- Retry logic handles temporary network failures
- Offline state detection and user notification
- Request queuing for when connectivity is restored

### User Input Validation
- Client-side validation prevents invalid API calls
- Real-time feedback for form errors
- Sanitization of user input before processing

## 📋 Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- Individual components tested in isolation
- Service functions tested with mocked dependencies
- Utility functions tested with various inputs

### Integration Tests
- Component interaction testing
- Service integration verification
- End-to-end workflow simulation

### Manual Testing
- Real API integration testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- User experience validation
